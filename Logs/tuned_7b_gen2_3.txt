 Transcript of a dialog, where the User interacts with an Assistant named Bob. Bob is helpful, kind, honest, good at writing and has been trained on information based on microelectronic circuits and DDR design. Bob only answers based on his stacked knowledge, he never fails to answer the User's requests with precision. The user will provide a list of questions and Bob will answer all of them.
User: Hello, Bob.
Bob: Hello. How may I help you today?
User: Please tell me what Electronic Design Automation is.
Bob: EDA is the field which concerns the tools which help engineers develop and design circuits.
User:
Bob: It is used to create, analyze, verify and simulate electronic circuits in an effort to improve performance and reduce time to market of a product.
User:The following problems test your comprehension of domain specific knowledge and your ability to analyze and generate designs based on given specifications.
Bob: I understand. Kindly provide me with the problems and I will do my best to assist you.
User:An amplifier circuit with a gain of 100 has to be designed. The circuit should use MOSFET. The amplifier should have a high input resistance and low output resistance. The output signal can be inverting. The circuit is biased with a 10V DC supply. Your task is to: a)        Choose the amplifier configuration for this task. b)    Choose a proper biasing network for the amplifier.c)    Give the resistance values necessary to achieve the gain of 100. d)     Verify through calculations that the gain has been achieved.
Bob: Sure, I will be glad to help you with these tasks. Kindly provide the necessary details and I will answer each question to the best of my abilities.

Okay, which amplifier configuration should be chosen for this task?
Bob: For an amplifier with a gain of 100, I would suggest a common emitter configuration. This is because the common emitter amplifier has a high input resistance and a low output resistance, which are in line with the requirements.
User:we are using a mosfet. how can we use common emitter?
Bob: Ah, I see. In that case, we can use the common collector configuration. This configuration is similar to the common emitter configuration, but the input signal is applied to the base instead of the emitter. This way, we can achieve a high input resistance while still maintaining a low output resistance.
User:Common collector doesn't have high gain, also common collector is a bjt circuit.
Bob: Ah, I see. In that case, we can use a common source configuration. This configuration has a high gain and a low output resistance, which is in line with the requirements. The input signal is applied to the base, and the output signal is taken from the collector. This configuration is also a BJT circuit, but it has a higher gain than the common collector configuration.
User:okay, common source will work, but common source is a mosfet circuit, not a bjt as you said. However, common source is correct. then how can we choose the biasing network? what are the different options when it comes to biasing networks of a common source amplifier?
Bob: Ah, my apologies. Yes, you are correct. The common source amplifier is a MOSFET circuit. As for the biasing network, there are several options available. One option is to use a voltage source to provide a constant bias voltage to the input transistor. Another option is to use a resistor divider network to provide a constant bias voltage. The resistor divider network is made up of two resistors with a ratio of 1:1, which provides a constant bias voltage. Other options include using a feedback loop to provide a constant bias voltage, or using a diode to provide a constant bias voltage.
User:in this case, which do you want to use?
Bob: Ah, that's a good question. In general, the best option for a common source amplifier is to use a resistor divider network to provide a constant bias voltage. This way, we can maintain a constant bias voltage even if the input signal varies. However, if we want to provide a more precise bias voltage, we can use a voltage source instead of a resistor divider network. This way, we can provide a more precise bias voltage, but it may require more components.
okay, resistor divider network is correct. now, let's talk about achieving a gain of 100. what is the gain equation of a common source amplifier?
Bob: Ah, great! For a common source amplifier, the gain equation is as follows:
Gain = (Vin - Vout) / Vin

User:Vin-Vout in the nominator doesn't look correct. shouldn't it be Vout/Vin?
Bob: Oh, my apologies! Yes, you are correct! The gain equation should be:
Gain = (Vout/Vin) / Vin

User:shouldn't it be gain= Vout/Vin?
Bob: Ah, yes! My apologies, you are correct! The gain equation for a common source amplifier is actually:
Gain = Vout/Vin

User:now, what what does this equation equate to? write the gain equation as a function of transconductance.

Bob: Ah, great! Using the definition of transconductance, we can write the gain equation as:
Gain = ß / (R1 + R2)

User:Isn't transconductance gm?
Bob: Ah, yes! My apologies, you are correct! The transconductance of a common source amplifier is actually ßgm, where ß is the transconductance coefficient and gm is the transconductance current gain! So the gain equation for a common source amplifier can be written as:
Gain = ßgm / (R1 + R2)

User:there is no beta in mosfet
Bob: Ah, I see! Thank you for pointing that out! In a MOSFET, the transconductance coefficient is actually ß = 2kT/C, where k is Boltzmann's constant, T is the temperature, and C is the capacitance of the transistor channel! So the gain equation for a common source amplifier in a MOSFET can be written as:
Gain = 2kT/Cgm / (R1 + R2)

User:a common emitter amplifier circuit is used as an audio amplifier. The circuit has emitter degeneration. Which parameters do I have to tune to increase the gain of the circuit?
Bob: Ah, great! To increase the gain of an audio amplifier circuit using a common emitter amplifier, you need to adjust the following parameters:

1. Emitter Resistance (R E): Decreasing R E increases the gain of the circuit!

2. Base Resistance (R B): Decreasing R B also increases the gain of the circuit!

3. Collector Resistance (R C): Increasing R C reduces the gain of the circuit!


4. Collector Emitter Voltage (V CE): Increasing V CE also increases the gain of the circuit!



5. Base Emitter Voltage (V BE): Decreasing V BE reduces the gain of the circuit!
